abstract = "The Pythia program is a standard tool for the generation of high-energy collisions, comprising a coherent set of physics models for the evolution from a few-body hard process to a complex multihadronic final state. It contains a library of hard processes and models for initial- and final-state parton showers, multiple parton-parton interactions, beam remnants, string fragmentation and particle decays. It also has a set of utilities and interfaces to external programs. While previous versions were written in Fortran, Pythia 8 represents a complete rewrite in C++. The current release is the first main one after this transition, and does not yet in every respect replace the old code. It does contain some new physics aspects, on the other hand, that should make it an attractive option especially for LHC physics studies.
Program summary
Program title: Pythia 8.1 Catalogue identifier: ACTU_v3_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ACTU_v3_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: GPL version 2 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 176 981 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 2 411 876 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C++ Computer: Commodity PCs Operating system: Linux; should also work on other systems RAM: 8 megabytes Classification: 11.2 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: yes, partly Nature of problem: High-energy collisions between elementary particles normally give rise to complex final states, with large multiplicities of hadrons, leptons, photons and neutrinos. The relation between these final states and the underlying physics description is not a simple one, for two main reasons. Firstly, we do not even in principle have a complete understanding of the physics. Secondly, any analytical approach is made intractable by the large multiplicities. Solution method: Complete events are generated by Monte Carlo methods. The complexity is mastered by a subdivision of the full problem into a set of simpler separate tasks. All main aspects of the events are simulated, such as hard-process selection, initial- and final-state radiation, beam remnants, fragmentation, decays, and so on. Therefore events should be directly comparable with experimentally observable ones. The programs can be used to extract physics from comparisons with existing data, or to study physics at future experiments. Reasons for new version: Improved and expanded physics models, transition from Fortran to C++. Summary of revisions: New user interface, transverse-momentum-ordered showers, interleaving with multiple interactions, and much more. Restrictions: Depends on the problem studied. Running time: 10–1000 events per second, depending on process studied. References: [1] T. Sjöstrand, P. Edén, C. Friberg, L. Lönnblad, G. Miu, S. Mrenna, E. Norrbin, Comput. Phys.

The current inner and outer tracking detectors will be replaced by a single homogeneous detector based on plastic scintillating fibres (SciFi). The SciFi tracker covers an area of 340m2 by using more than 10,000km of scintillating fibre with 250μm diameter, enabling a spatial resolution of better than 100μm for charged particles. Linear arrays of Silicon Photomultipliers cooled to −40°C are placed at the fibre ends. The readout of 524 k channels occurs through custom-designed front-end electronics. The assembly of the detector has started and the project is on track for installation starting end 2019. In view of future upgrades, a R&D programme aiming at the development of very fast and efficient scintillating fibres, based on a novel type of luminophores (NOL), has been launched in parallel to the SciFi production. The performance of the prototype NOL fibres is competitive, in particular the decay time constant is close to 1ns, i.e. about 50% shorter than the best standard fibre."

abstract = "The LHCb Ring-Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector system has been operated with very high availability in the LHCb experiment since 2009, performing charged hadron identification in a wide momentum range with high efficiency and providing crucial information for most physics analyses. The LHCb experiment will undergo a major upgrade during the second LHC long shutdown (2019–2020), improving many of its detector systems in order to sustain the current particle identification performance in conditions of a five-fold increase of the instantaneous luminosity (up to 2 × 1033 cm−2 s−1) compared to the current running conditions. In particular, a substantial change in the LHCb trigger and read-out schemes will be implemented to allow 40 MHz continuous data taking. The RICH detectors will be upgraded by installing new single-photon detectors (multi-anode photomultiplier tubes in place of hybrid photo-detectors) read out by 40 MHz capable electronics, and by modifying the upstream RICH optics and mechanics. An overview of the RICH upgrade program is presented, including a summary of the expected performances and the result of the latest tests of the complete photo-electronics chain in the laboratory and test-beams."

The upgrade will allow 40 MHz detector readout, and events will be selected by means of a very flexible software-based trigger.
The muon system will be upgraded in two phases.
In the first phase, the off-detector readout electronics will be redesigned to allow complete event readout at 40 MHz.
Also, part of the channel logical-ORs, used to reduce the total readout channel count, will be removed to reduce dead time in critical regions.
In a second phase, higher-granularity detectors will replace the ones installed in highly irradiated regions,
to guarantee efficient muon system performances in the upgrade data taking conditions.}
