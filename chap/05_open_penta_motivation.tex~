\label{chap:pentaquark}



\section{Study motivation}

Over the last two decades, a wealth of information has been accumulated on the decays of $b$-hadrons.
Measurements of their decays have been used to test the CKM mechanism~\cite{PhysRevLett.10.531} for describing weak decay phenomena in the Standard Model, 
as well as provide measurements against which various theoretical approaches, 
such as heavy quark effective theory ~\cite{EICHTEN1990511} and the factorization hypothesis, can be compared.
While many decays have been measured, 
a large number remain either unobserved or poorly measured, most notably decays of \Lb baryons.
LHCb has observed many new $\Lb$ decays to open charm modes, 
such as $\Lb\to\Lc\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-Define}, 
$\Lb\to\Lc \pi^- \proton \antiproton$~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2018-005}, 
and $\Lb\to \Lc D^-_{(s)}$~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2014-002}. 
We report the discovery of the \LbLckkpi decay in this note, where the \Lc decays to \Pp \Km \pip.
\footnote{Charge conjugate final states are implied throughout.}

Besides, 
the $\LbLckkpi$ decay also provides an opportunity to search for possible single charmed pentaquarks ($c\bar{s}uud$) 
that could decay strongly to $\Lc\Kp$.
The LHCb experiment observed two pentaquark states using $\Lb\to \jpsi p K^-$ decays in 2015~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2015-029}.
This discovery motivates us to search for more pentaquark states.
Recently Belle reported an observation of a new $\Xic(2930)^0$ resonance decay to $\Lc\Km$ in $\Bu\to \Lc\Lcbar \Kp$ decays~\cite{Li:2017uvv}, 
and we can also examine the decays of resonances e.g. $\Xicz\to \Lc\Km$.


In the analysis of \LbLcpppi, 
the decay of \LbLckkpi has been shown as a background.
Figure~\ref{fig:feynman} shows possible contributing Feynman diagrams to the $\Lb \to \Lc \Km \Kp \pi^-$ decay.
As the knowledge about this channel is poor, the first step is  the measurement of the branching ratio.

The branching fraction of the \LbLckkpi decay with respect to that of the \LbLcDs decay (with \Dskkpi), defined as
\begin{equation}
R \equiv \frac{\BR( \LbLckkpi)}{\BR( \LbLcDskkpi)}
\end{equation}
is measured in this analysis. 
The \LbLcDs(\Dskkpi) decay channel is taken as a normalization channel, 
which has identical final states as that of the signal channel to cancel large systematic uncertainties. 
The ratio is determined as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:relativeBR}
\begin{split}
	R &= \frac{\BR( \LbLckkpi)}{\BR( \LbLcDskkpi)} \\
        &=\frac{N(\LbLckkpi)}{N(\LbLcDskkpi)}\,\frac{\epsilon(\LbLcDskkpi)}{\epsilon(\LbLckkpi)},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
by measuring the numbers ($N$) of candidates from signal and normalization modes 
and the relative efficiency ($\epsilon$) between the \LbLckkpi and \LbLcDs(\Dskkpi) decays.
