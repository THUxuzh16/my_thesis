\label{sec:branching_fraction}

The branching fraction is calculated using this function:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{N(\Lb\to\Lc\Kp\Km \pi^-)}{N(\LbLcDskkpi)} = R \times \frac{\epsilon(\Lb \to \Lc \Kp \Km \pi^-)}{\epsilon(\LbLcDskkpi)},
\end{equation}
where $N(\LbLckkpi)$ and $N(\LbLcDskkpi)$ are the yields for signal and normalization channels, 
$R$ is the relative branching fraction, 
$\epsilon(\LbLckkpi)$ and $\epsilon(\LbLcDskkpi)$ are the efficiencies for signal and normalization channels.
The relative branching fraction obtained is $1.7127 \pm 0.0692$,
which only includes statistical error from data, 
for the MC sample statistical error will be considered in the systematic uncertainty.
