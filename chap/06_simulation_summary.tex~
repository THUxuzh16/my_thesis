\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:summary}

The parameterized simulation tool for \ecal upgrade was developed based on \gauss and \delphes.
By studing two decay channels,
we found the high luminosity causes a very level of combinatorial background.
The precision timing can help to remove many backgound candidates, 
and the needed time resolution is around several tens of picosecond.
Besides,
the smaller cell size is necessary for \upgradetwo,
as it has a great impact to reconstruction efficiency.

Then,
a detailed Si-W \ecal simulation is performed with a stand-alone \geant package. 
%The input is obtained from \gauss with the beam conditions set for the \lhcb \upgradetwo, 
%corresponding to an instantaneous luminosity of $1.5\times10^{34}\cm^{-2}\cdot\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
The energy resolution and time resolution are obtained from this simulation,
and these values can meet the requirements for \ecal \upgradetwo at \lhcb.
Two decay chennels are studied in this simulation tool, 
and these results fall in line with parameterized simulation findings.
