\section{Conclusions}

A full amplitude fit to the $\Lb\to \jpsi p \pi^-$ decay is performed.  
The data cannot be satisfactorily described by the well established $N^*$ resonances for the $m(\jpsi p)$ distribution in $m(p\pi)>1.8$\gev. 
%A satisfactory fit can be achieved by either including the $\ZC(4200)^-$ reported by the Belle collaboration 
%or the two $\ZP$ states observed in the $\Lb \to \jpsi p K^-$ decay. 
%If including both types of the exotic resonances, the total significance for them is 6.5$\sigma$.
%While we cannot distinguish their individual contribution to the significance, 
%because of strong correlation between the two  broad $\ZC(4200)^-$ and $P_c(4380)^+$ states. 
%Their fit fractions are measured to be $(5.1\pm1.5_{-1.6}^{+1.8})\%$, $(1.6_{-0.6-0.5}^{+0.8+0.6})\%$ and $(7.7\pm2.8_{-4.0}^{+1.9})\%$ for the $P_c(4380)^+$, 
%$P_c(4450)^+$ and $\ZC(4200)^-$ states, respectively. 
%Furthermore relative branching fractions
%$
%{\cal B}(\Lb \to \pi^- P_c^+)/{\cal B}(\Lb \to K^- P_c^+)
%$
%are determined as $0.050\pm0.016_{-0.016}^{+0.018}\pm0.025$ for the $P_c(4380)^+$ state 
%and
%$0.033_{-0.014-0.009}^{+0.016+0.011}\pm0.009$ for the $P_c(4450)^+$ state,
%respective, 
%where the first is the statistical,  
%the second is the systematic related to the $\jpsi p \pi^-$ decay and the third the systematic related to the $\jpsi p K^-$ decay. 
%They are consistent with a prediction of (0.7-0.8)\% within uncertainties.
%
%Assuming no $\ZC(4200)^-$ is present, 
%the significance for the $P_c(4380)^+$ is 6.6$\sigma$ and that for the two $P_c^+$ states is 6.7$\sigma$. 
%On the other hand, 
%if we assume no $P_c^+$ is present, 
%$Z_c(4200)^-$ constitutes a significance of 6.2$\sigma$. 
%In all of the scenarios, 
%because of limited statistics, 
%we only see a hint for the narrow $P_c(4450)^+$ state, 
%that is clearly seen in the favored $\Lb \to \jpsi p K^-$ decay. 
%More data is needed to have a clear picture for the $P_c(4450)^+$ state and to distinguish these scenarios.
%
%We have also investigated an extreme case to include the unconfirmed high mass $N^*$ resonances, 
%that can improve the fit in the high $m(p\pi)$. In such case, the exotic contribution is still evident.

Fitting stablility with different models should be studied soon,
which will be taken as systematic uncertainties.
A further plan is to obtain more information from $\Lb\to\jpsi\proton\Km$ amplitude analysis.
