Exotic hadrons, 
with quark configurations other than three quarks or quark-antiquark,
are capable of revealing new or hidden aspects of the dynamics of the strong interactions,
which is discribed by quantum chromodynamics.
This dissertation examines the experimental evidences of exotic states over the decades,
especially some results and potential studies at \lhcb.
Besides,
some theoretical explanations to exotic hadrons are also simply investigated.


More than twenty non-standard hadrons that contain $\ccbar$ or $\bbbar$ quarks have been found and studied,
among which charged states like $Z_c(3900)^+$ and $Z_c(4430)^+$ are smoking-gun evidence for tetraquark exotic states, 
because light quarks are apparent to account for the non-zero electric charge, 
in addition to the heavy quarkonium. 
Previously, only the \uquark or \dquark were observed to constitute the light quarks in such charged exotic states. 
For the first time, 
we observe two $Z_{cs}^+$ states decaying into $\jpsi K^+$ and  and several $X$ states decaying into $\jpsi \phi$ 
from a 6-dimentional amplitude analysis of $\Bp\to\jpsi \phi K^+$ decays 
by using the data sample collected at \lhcb during Run 1 and Run 2. 
The most significant states are $1^+$ $Z_{cs}(4000)^+$ hadron with a width of $131\pm15\pm26$\mev and $1^{++}$ $X(4685)$ state,
and both states present a significance over 15$\sigma$. 
It should also be mentioned 
that four $X\to\jpsi\phi$ states previously observed by LHCb and their $J^{PC}$ measurements are also confirmed.


Open-charm pentaquark will open a major new window in exotic hadron study,
thus searching for this kind of state is performed in $\Lb\to\Lc\Kp\Km\pim$ decay
through a data sample of proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of $\sqs=7$ and 8\tev collected by the \lhcb detector.
However,
no obvious open-charm pentaquark structure appeared,
so this dissertation reports the first observtion of $\Lb\to\Lc\Kp\Km\pim$ decay.
The ratio of branching fractions between the $\Lb\to\Lc\Kp\Km\pim$ and the $\Lb\to\Lc\Dsm$ decays is measured to be 
$\BR( \Lb\to\Lc\Kp\Km\pim )\slash\BR( \Lb\to\Lc\Dsm)=(9.26 \pm 0.29 \pm 0.46 \pm 0.26)\times10^{-2}$,
where the first uncertainty is statistical, 
the second systematic and the third is due to the knowledge of the $\Dsm\to\Kp\Km\pim$ branching fraction. 


The \lhcb spectrometer will run in uttermost high luminosity situation after \upgradetwo, 
which will provide the opportunity to investigate many open questions in flavour physics.
However,
high luminosity will deteriorate particle recontruction ability of \lhcb detectors,
especially for \ecal.
In view of this situation,
a parameterized simualtion tool was developed to study the impact of high lumonisity in several physics decay channels containing $\g$ or \piz.
It was found that small cell size and precision timing can not only play an important role in counteracting the overlapping effect,
but also improve the mass resolution and reconstruction efficiency for B-mesons.
Subsequently,
a standalone simulaiton framework for multi-layer silicon-tungsten (Si-W) \ecal was constructed.
Via the simulation,
the Si-W \ecal performs well in some physics channels with high luminosity situation,
and conclusions obtained from parameterized simulaiton were verified as well.
In consideration of the cost,
the idea to measure time using 3 Si-W layers is also proposed.
