%\section{Study motivation}
%
%In 2015,
%\lhcb reported significant structures in $\jpsi\proton$ mass spectrum in $\Lb\to\jpsi\proton\Km$ decay,
%which were the first observation of pentaqurks candidates\supercite{LHCb-PAPER-2015-024}.
%This observation were checked by model independent way\supercite{LHCb-PAPER-2016-009},
%where the \jpsi\proton structure near $4450\mev$ was too narrow to discribed by $\proton\Km$ contributions.
